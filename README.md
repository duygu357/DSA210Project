# DSA 210 Project
## Overview

Electric vehicles (EVs) have rapidly gained prominence due to technological advances, environmental concerns, and evolving consumer preferences. In today’s market, understanding the factors that drive consumer behavior toward EVs is crucial for manufacturers, policymakers, and researchers. This project leverages data science and machine learning techniques to analyze EV consumer behavior and identify key trends and predictors of EV adoption.

## Project Motivation

The automotive industry is undergoing a transformative shift toward electrification. However, consumer acceptance remains a major determinant of market success. By analyzing data on EV sales, consumer sentiment, and various vehicle attributes, this project aims to uncover insights that can help forecast EV adoption trends. The findings will provide valuable guidance for strategic planning, marketing, and policy-making, ultimately supporting a smoother transition to sustainable transportation.

## How to implement - ROADMAP

### Data Collection

#### Spatial Data

Average Altitude:
Identify a reliable source (e.g., NASA’s SRTM data or open-source GIS datasets) for global or regional altitude data.
Extract the data and calculate average altitude values for different regions or for the entire world.
This is useful because EV performance can be affected by altitude, which may impact consumer behavior.

Charging Station Locations:
Find a dataset (such as Open Charge Map or government/industry sources) that provides coordinates of EV charging stations.
Ensure the collected coordinates are in a consistent format for further analysis.

#### EV Sales and Performance Data

Kaggle Datasets:
Search Kaggle for EV sales data that includes country-level sales, brand information, and key performance metrics (such as charging time, range, price, and body style).
Download and import the dataset.

EXTRA – Brand Analysis
Collect additional data to understand the market position of different EV brands.
Classify brands based on market presence, reliability, and safety factors (for example, the number of car accidents and fatal accidents).
